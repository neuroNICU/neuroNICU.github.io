Week 1: Our developer team (Salina Thongsisavath, Adam Bell, Samantha Mallari) met with our project sponsor, Dr. Tarrit and her PhD student, Weihao Xin. We discussed the goals of the project and the timeline for the next few months.

## Introductions
Our team consists of: Salina Thongsisavath, Adam Bell, and Samantha Mallari. We are all undergraduate students at the University of Hawai'i at Manoa, and are excited to work on this project. 

Our team met on Discord to set up our GitHub Organization, assign roles, and discuss the project. We are using GitHub for version control and collaboration. We also decided to set up weekly development meetings using Discord for communication and collaboration.

Dr. Katy Tarrit, a professor at UH Manoa in the Information Computer Science Department, and Weihao Xin is her PhD student.

## Getting Set Up on GitHub
During our meeting with Dr. Tarrit, we added Dr. Tarrit and Weihao to our GitHub organization so everyone has access to our project.

We will be using GitHub for collaboration and tracking changes to our code. Github Pages will be used to host our website. We will also be using GitHub Issues to track bugs and feature requests. Additionally, we will be using GitHub Projects to track our progress and manage our tasks.

## Understanding the Project

Dr. Tarrit explained the goals of the project and the timeline for the next few months. The goal of the project is to create a MATLAB application that allows users to configure Oddball Task Experiments. The application will also allow users to play the experiment audio files with minimal latency. The application will be used by Dr. Tarrit's auditory-neuroscience research team to conduct experiments on auditory processing and attention.
